# bluetooth-controlled-car

To develop a mobile application that enables the user to control the movement of the car. The medium used for communication between Smart phone and the Arduino is a Bluetooth module (HC-05). The Arduino receives the command from the Bluetooth and controls the driver motor based on the commands. The mobile application is developed using Android Studio.Since the project involves controlling the driver motors, we need a motor driver shield that requires the entire Arduino for connection. 
Hence to interface with the Bluetooth, we require another Arduino. So this project uses two Arduino.One Arduino acts as a master, that receives values from the Bluetooth module and the other acts as slave that is used to run the gear motors. The master interacts with the mobile application using the Bluetooth module. It then commands the slave. I2C communication is used for communication between master and the slave.
The commands from the android can be : Forward, Backward, Forward Right, Forward Left, Reverse Right, Reverse Left. these commands are sent to the master Arduino via the bluetooth module which is transmitted to the slave. the slave Arduino is connected to the motor shield that controls the motors.
